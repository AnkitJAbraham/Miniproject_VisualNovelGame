            Visual narrative games are video games that focus on storytelling through visuals, using cutscenes, dialogue, and character interactions to advance the narrative. They are based on the visual novel genre of literature. A notable example is "Ace Attorney", a Japanese visual novel based game. Interactive storytelling is a form of digital entertainment in which the storyline is not predetermined. The author creates the setting, characters, and situation which the narrative must address, but the user (also reader or player) experiences a unique story based on their interactions and choices.

            <b>Therefore, our goal was to produce a playable game which combines the above characteristics.</b></p>
