INT. VENICE - DAY

The bustling city of Venice is alive with merchants, sailors, and locals going about their daily business. ANTONIO, a wealthy merchant, and his friend BASSANIO stroll through the streets.

ANTONIO
Bassanio, my friend, what troubles your mind today?

BASSANIO
Antonio, I find myself in a predicament. I am deeply in debt and seek a loan to woo the beautiful Portia. I plan to travel to Belmont for a chance to win her hand.

ANTONIO
My dear friend, I am at your service. Although my own fortunes are tied up in my merchant ships, I will help you. We shall visit SHYLOCK, a Jewish moneylender, to secure the loan.

INT. SHYLOCK'S OFFICE - DAY

Antonio and Bassanio enter SHYLOCK'S office. Shylock eyes them cautiously.

SHYLOCK
What brings you to my doorstep, Antonio? Your ventures are notorious for their risks.

ANTONIO
I seek a loan, Shylock. I will provide you a pound of my flesh as collateral, and if I fail to repay, you may take it.

SHYLOCK
(rubbing his hands)
Very well, Antonio. We shall draw up the bond. But beware, if you default, the bond shall be enforced.

INT. BELMONT - NIGHT

Bassanio arrives in Belmont, where Portia's estate is located. He meets with PORTIA and her LADY-IN-WAITING, NERISSA.

PORTIA
Welcome, Bassanio. I shall test your love for me through a riddle. Choose wisely, for my hand and fortune hang in the balance.

Bassanio contemplates his choices, aided by Nerissa's advice.

INT. VENICE - DAY

Meanwhile, Antonio's merchant ships are caught in a storm, and they sink. News of his misfortune reaches Shylock, who sees an opportunity for revenge.

SHYLOCK
(maliciously)
Antonio has defaulted on his loan. Now I shall have my pound of flesh!

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

The case is brought before the Duke of Venice, who presides over the trial.

PORTIA (disguised as a lawyer)
Hear me, noble Venetians. I offer legal counsel to Antonio.

Portia cleverly argues the terms of the bond and uncovers Shylock's malicious intent. She finds a loophole that could save Antonio's life.

PORTIA
Shylock, you may have your pound of flesh, but you must not spill a drop of Antonio's blood. If you do, all your wealth shall be confiscated.

Shylock realizes he has been outsmarted and reluctantly agrees to accept the money instead.

INT. BELMONT - NIGHT

Bassanio successfully solves Portia's riddle and wins her hand in marriage. They celebrate their newfound love and fortune.

ANTONIO
(reunited with Bassanio)
My friend, your happiness is mine. Let us rejoice and put this ordeal behind us.

The friends embrace, grateful for the lessons they have learned and the bonds that have been tested and strengthened.

FADE OUT.
