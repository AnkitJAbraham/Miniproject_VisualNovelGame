    worthy a husband in my eyes as anyone else."

    moroccan_prince "Dear Portia, your words are a testament to your wisdom and beauty that transcends mere appearances. 
    I am deeply honored by your kind sentiments."

    moroccan_prince"It is true that the lottery places both of us in a position where our fates are determined by chance rather than choice. 
    However, your recognition of my worth as a potential husband fills my heart with joy and admiration."

    moroccan_prince "Now, may I request your assistance in leading me to the caskets, as I wish to test
    my luck. With this sword, I have achieved victories over Persia's leader
    and a prince, as well as conquered Sultan Solyman in three battles."

    man to win your hand, causing me immense grief."

    you choose a casket that if you choose the wrong one you will never
    speak to a lady about marriage again. Be warned."
